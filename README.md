# Stacks & Queues & Linked Lists

## Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## Introduction

This project provides an implementation of various data structures and algorithms using stacks, queues, and linked lists. Through this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of these fundamental data structures and their applications. The project code is written in a clear and concise manner, with detailed comments throughout to facilitate easy understanding and modification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of programming concepts and basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists. Additionally, you will need to have a programming environment set up with a compatible language, such as Python, C++, or Java.

### Installation

To get started with this project, you can simply clone the repository and open it in your programming environment.
